## 🔥 Team Velocity

**Hours worked today:** ~6-7 hours  
**Effective progress:** ~2 days worth  
**Reason:** Good architecture decisions upfront

**Blockers encountered:** 2
1. Solana CLI SSL error (resolved)
2. Vercel root directory (resolved)

**Time lost to blockers:** ~2 hours  
**Time saved by preparation:** ~4 hours  
**Net gain:** +2 hours

---

## 🎯 Success Factors

**What's working well:**
1. Clear architecture from Day 1
2. All code written before deploying
3. Parallel work (frontend while contract builds)
4. Good documentation habits
5. Fast problem-solving

**What to maintain:**
1. Keep committing frequently
2. Test each component
3. Document as we go
4. Stay focused on MVP
5. Don't over-engineer

## 🚨 Risks to Monitor

**Low Risk:**
- Anchor install taking long (normal, will finish)
- Transaction signing (well-documented)
- Email delivery (using reliable service)

**Medium Risk:**
- Integration bugs (expected, will debug)
- Wallet adapter edge cases (can work around)

**Managed Risks:**
- Time (ahead of schedule)
- Scope (focused on MVP)
- Quality (high standards maintained)

---

## 💬 Communication

**GitHub:** https://github.com/dumplingsol/agent-hackathon  
**Commits:** 7 (clean, descriptive)  
**Vercel:** Deployed and live  
**Forum:** Not posted yet (will do after working demo)

---

## 🎉 Wins Today

1. ✅ Cleared both major blockers
2. ✅ Frontend fully integrated
3. ✅ Professional documentation
4. ✅ Code is clean and maintainable
5. ✅ Ahead of timeline
6. ✅ High team morale

---

**Bottom Line:** We're crushing it! Once Anchor finishes installing, we're 1 hour away from a working demo. 

**Sleep well knowing:** Tomorrow we deploy! 🚀
